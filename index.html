        <p>
            I am currently a graduate student in university of washington studying chemical engineering, and
            my research topic is the application of data science in the organic photovoltaic development.
        </p>

        <p>
            I gained my bachelor degree on petroleum engineering in Colorado School of Mine. The reason I 
            switched major was because I am more interested in the development and deployment of renewable 
            energy. I have done two projects during the DIRECT (data intensive training program) offered by 
            CEI (Clean Energy Institute) in UW. My first project was about <strong>quantitative relationship between 
            molecular structure and properties</strong>, and the second capstone project was estimation of <strong>possible 
            total solar potential in the area of city of Anchorage, Alaska</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to gain deeper understanding in computer science and a broader scope,
            I come to this coding bootcamp and wish to learn.            
        </p>
